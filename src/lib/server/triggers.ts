//   faction_change  whisper a message to players who switch from one faction to another
//   broadcast    rotate through messages every N minutes while the player count is in its band
//   empty_reset  send an empty server back to a chosen map after N minutes
//   risk_kick    kick joiners who match Steam / ban-list rules (see risk.ts)
//   ping_kick    kick players whose ping stays above a limit
//   team_kill    whisper or kick a player over team kills the kill feed reports (feed-events.ts)
//   kill_rate    flag a player whose kills in a short window are too many or too many headshots
//                (kill-rate.ts, acted on in feed-events.ts)
//   seed_reward  hand players who stay through a low population a reserved slot, on this server
//                or across the org
//   two_teams    close one faction and move its players to the smaller of the other two
//                (two-teams.ts)
//   kill_distance  flag, kick or ban a player who kills with a chosen weapon from further than it
//                reaches (kill-distance.ts, acted on in feed-events.ts)
// The worker evaluates them on every observation and writes the actions they want to the outbox
// (outbox.ts delivers, and every delivery lands in the audit trail as category "trigger"). A dry
// run replays the last 24 hours from the samples and sessions tables so a rule can be checked
